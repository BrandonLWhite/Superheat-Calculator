Superheat-Calculator
====================

An Excel spreadsheet for calculating target and actual superheat for R22 refrigerant.  This is commonly used when charging an air conditioning system utilizing a fixed orifice metering device.  The exact values are calculated based upon your input temperature and pressure measurements.  This results in precise superheat values superior to what you would get from chart-based tools.
